# .NET MAUI Cookbook Giveaway Project

Recently, I hosted a giveaway for my [.NET MAUI Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/NET-MAUI-Cookbook-full-featured-authentication/dp/1835461123). To make it more fun, I recorded a video where I built a .NET MAUI project to randomly select the winner. This repository contains the project from that video.

In this reposiroty, I use DevExpress [.NET MAUI components](https://www.devexpress.com/maui/). You need to configure a [DevExpress NuGet feed](https://docs.devexpress.com/MAUI/404024/get-started/register-nuget-gallery) to run the project.
