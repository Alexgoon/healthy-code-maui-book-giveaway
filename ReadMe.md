# .NET MAUI Cookbook Giveaway Project

Recently, I hosted a giveaway for my [.NET MAUI Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/NET-MAUI-Cookbook-full-featured-authentication/dp/1835461123). To make it more fun, I recorded a video where I built a .NET MAUI project to randomly select the winner. This repository contains the project from that video.
